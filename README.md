## Pre-Engineering Notebook

### Part 1 - Base
For this assignment I designed the base of the caster, which didn't give me any problems. I learned how much time you can save by using keyboard shortcuts rather than having to use your mouse for everything.

### Part 2 - Mount
For this assignment I designed the mount that attaches to the base of the caster. I learned about how easy it is to create a new part in Onshape by extruding as a new part using mostly sketch geometry from the first part, and also how Onshape handles patterns in sketchs, by creating the necessary sketch geometry and dimensions, allowing for easier editing.

### Part 3 - Fork
For this assignment I designed the fork piece of the caster. One thing I learned in this assignment is that you can use tangent propogation to avoid having to select multiple edges.

### Part 4 - Tire
For this assignment I designed the tire of the wheel of the caster. I learned that when you dimension from a centerline, if you drag the dimension past the centerline, it will double, allowing you to use this as the diameter of a revolved feature.
