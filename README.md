## Pre-Engineering Notebook

### Part 1 - Base
For this assignment I designed the base of the caster, which didn't give me any problems. I learned how much time you can save by using keyboard shortcuts rather than having to use your mouse for everything.

### Part 2 - Mount
For this assignment I designed the mount that attaches to the base of the caster. I learned about how easy it is to create a new part in Onshape by extruding as a new part using mostly sketch geometry from the first part, and also how Onshape handles patterns in sketchs, by creating the necessary sketch geometry and dimensions, allowing for easier editing.

### Part 3 - Fork
For this assignment I designed the fork piece of the caster. One thing I learned in this assignment is that you can use tangent propogation to avoid having to select multiple edges.

### Part 4 - Tire
For this assignment I designed the tire of the wheel of the caster. I learned that when you dimension from a centerline, if you drag the dimension past the centerline, it will double, allowing you to use this as the diameter of a revolved feature.

### Part 5 - Wheel
For this assignment I designed the wheel of the caster. I learned that Onshape allows you to select all of the edges of a face to fillet or chamfer by only selecting the face.

### Parts 6-9 Axle, Collar, Bearings
For this assignment I designed the axle, adding a seperate part for the collar, then designed two bearings. I learned how convenient it is to make new parts in the same part studio in Onshape.

### Sub-Assembly
For this assignment I made a sub-assembly with the wheel, tire, axle, and bearings. I learned roughly how Onshape mates work, by using mate connecters and inferring intent, and how to animate rotating parts in assemblies.

### Final Caster Assembly
For this assignment I assembled the whole caster and added screws and pins to hold the parts together. I had a small issue when I accidentally deleted a part from the assembly, but it was easy enough to fix using the version control, especially relative to Solidworks, where I would have had to redo quite a bit of lost work. I also learned how to insert standard nuts, bolts, pins, etc.
